  Hello, My name is Clodagh Kenny. I go to Oak Ridge High School
  <br> and will be a senior next year. I am really excited for the
  <br> oppurtunities that being a senior holds. I was born in Red
  <br> Wood City, and moved to El Dorado Hills when I was five years
  <br> old. I have two sisters, one younger and one older. I am the
  <br> middle child, which has many disadvantages. My younger sisters
  <br> is going to be a junior next year and my older sister will be
  <br> a junior at Purdue University next year.

  This summer, I participated in Girls WHo Code in GoDaddy offices
  <br> in Sunnyvale, California. Within this program I learned how
  <br> to code in Python, Arduino, HTML and scratch. I also learned
  <br> more about robots through the robotics unit. In this unit we
  <br> coded in Arduino to make the robot move in the way that we
  <br> desired. This was by far my most favorite unit out of all of
  <br> the units we have done thus far. Additionally, we vistied Go
  <br> Daddys offices in San Francisco, where we had the oppurtunity
  <br> to learn what computer scientists do on a daily basis.
